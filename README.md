# BASIC COUNTER [Using React]
  - This is my very first project using react , previously I was making projects using HTML , CSS and JS .
  - To access project , go inside src folder.
  - All credits goes to BroCode [Youtube] , for this great introduction to react .
  - It is just a Simple counter , with 3 buttons i.e Increment , Decrement and Reset .
  - Added Few Designs and I did not add any responsiveness since it has minimal components .
  - Uploaded all the files except node_modules folder .
